# Biff Cross

I am a photographer from Lowestoft, currently studdying at Norwich University of the Arts. I have experience in portrature, action sports and fine art photography. I also have experience in mediums such as analouge photography, moving image and digital.
For digital photography and videography I currently shoot on a Canon EOS R and a Canon EOS 800d. For film photography I shoot on a Canon A-1 and a canon EOS 300. I use a wide variety of lenses to capture my subjects, but my favourite is the 50mm.
I am mainly experementing with skateboarding photography, however I have experience with studio and on location portrature and comersial photography, as well as fine art photography.
