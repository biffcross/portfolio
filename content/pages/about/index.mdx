# Biff Cross

I am a photographer from Lowestoft, currently studdying at Norwich University of the Arts. 

I have experience in the following areas of photography:
* Portrature
* Action sports
* Fine art photography 
* Comercial and Studio

In mediums such as *analogue photography*, *moving image* and *digital*.

For digital photography and videography I currently shoot on a Canon EOS R and a Canon EOS 800d. For film photography I shoot on a Canon A-1 and a canon EOS 300. I use a wide variety of lenses to capture my subjects, but my favourite is the 50mm.

I am mainly experementing with skateboarding photography, however I have experience with studio and on location portrature and commercial photography, as well as fine art photography.
